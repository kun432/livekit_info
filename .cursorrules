# LiveKit Agents 1.0 Migration Rules

These rules help transform your existing agent code to be compatible with Agents 1.0. Please review each change carefully and run tests after applying these rules.

---

## 1. Update Module Imports

### Rule 1.1: Consolidate Agent Imports
- **Find:**  
 
```python
from livekit.agents.voice_assistant
```

*	Replace with:
	
`from livekit.agents.voice`

Rule 1.2: Consolidate Multimodal and Pipeline Imports

*	Find:

`from livekit.agents.multimodal`


*	Replace with:

`from livekit.agents.voice`


*	Find:

`from livekit.agents.pipeline`


*	Replace with:

`from livekit.agents.voice`



Rule 1.3: Adjust Any Other Deprecated Import References

*	Find:

`import VoiceAssistant`


*	Replace with:

`import VoiceAgent`

2. Update TTS Configuration

Rule 2.1: Remove Deprecated Options

*	Find any line containing:

`optimize_stream_latency`


*	Action:
Delete or comment out these lines (the option is deprecated).

Rule 2.2: Insert TTS Prewarm Call

*	Search for TTS instantiation (example):

`tts = cartesia.TTS( ... )`


*	After this line, insert:

`await tts.prewarm()`



Note: Adjust the placement based on your async flow.

3. Function Signature and Formatting Adjustments

Rule 3.1: Update Function Definition Format

*	Example (in `update_versions.py`):
*	Find:

```
def update_py_version(
    project_root: pathlib.Path, py_version_path: pathlib.Path
) -> str | None:
```

*	Replace with:

```
def update_py_version(project_root: pathlib.Path, py_version_path: pathlib.Path) -> str | None:
```


Rule 3.2: Join Split Logging Strings

*	Find patterns where log strings are broken into multiple lines unnecessarily (e.g., using string concatenation with newline characters).
*	Action:
Replace with a single-line string or proper multi-line formatting using parentheses.

4. Update Dependency Versions in Requirements Files

Rule 4.1: LiveKit Agents Version

*	Find in any requirements.txt:

`livekit-agents>=0.12.17`


*	Replace with:

`livekit-agents>=1.0.0`



Rule 4.2: Plugin Version Updates

*	Deepgram:
Find:

`livekit-plugins-deepgram>=0.7.0`

Replace with:

`livekit-plugins-deepgram>=TBD`


*	OpenAI:
Find:

`livekit-plugins-openai>=1.0.1`

Replace with:

`livekit-plugins-openai>=TBD`


*	Cartesia:
Find:

`livekit-plugins-cartesia>=0.4.9`

Replace with:

`livekit-plugins-cartesia>=TBD`


*	ElevenLabs:
Find:

`livekit-plugins-elevenlabs>=0.8.0`

Replace with:

`livekit-plugins-elevenlabs>=TBD`

5. Review and Manual Adjustments

*	Avatar and Minimal Worker Examples:
Compare your implementation with the updated examples in the examples/ folder. Adjust worker instantiation, room connection logic, and audio/video stream handling as needed.
*	Custom Logic:
Any custom transformations or business logic that depend on the old APIs may require manual review and refactoring.
*	Testing:
Run your full test suite and validate agent behavior to ensure that all changes are correctly applied.

Final Notes

After applying these cursor rules, it is highly recommended to:

*	Manually inspect the changes,
*	Perform a comprehensive code review, and
*	Run integration tests to catch any unforeseen issues.
